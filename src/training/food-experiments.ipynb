`EXPERIMENT_ID = 1` → Inception v3 (Head only)\n   - `EXPERIMENT_ID = 2` → Inception-ResNet-v2 (Head only)\n   - `EXPERIMENT_ID = 3` → Inception v3 (Full backbone)\n   - `EXPERIMENT_ID = 4` → Inception-ResNet-v2 (Full backbone)\n\n2. **Run all cells** to execute the selected experiment\n\n3. **Outputs will be saved** to `/kaggle/working/exp{N}_{ModelName}/`:\n   - `best_model.pt` - Best model checkpoint\n   - `final_model.pt` - Final model after all epochs\n   - `confusion_matrix.png` - Confusion matrix visualization\n   - `training_history.png` - Training curves\n   - `results.json` - Complete metrics\n   - `training.log` - Detailed logs\n\n### Features\n\n✅ **Universal code** - One notebook for all 4 experiments  \n✅ **Auto dataset detection** - Works with different Kaggle dataset structures  \n✅ **Auto train/val/test split** - Creates splits if not pre-split  \n✅ **Inception v3** support added  \n✅ **Model saving** - Both best and final checkpoints  \n✅ **Confusion matrix** - Visual analysis of predictions  \n✅ **Detailed logging** - Timestamps, metrics, throughput  \n✅ **Mixed precision** training for faster execution  \n✅ **Performance metrics** - Precision, recall, F1, latency, throughput  \n\n### Dataset Structure\n\nThis notebook automatically detects and handles two dataset structures:\n\n1. **Pre-split structure** (preferred):\n   ```\n   dataset/\n   ├── train/\n   │   ├── class1/\n   │   ├── class2/\n   │   ...\n   ├── validation/\n   │   ├── class1/\n   │   ├── class2/\n   │   ...\n   └── test/\n       ├── class1/\n       ├── class2/\n       ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Single directory structure**:\n   ```\n   dataset/\n   ├── class1/\n   ├── class2/\n   ...\n   ```\n   Will automatically split 70/15/15 for train/val/test\n\n### Main Logic Preserved\n\nThe core training logic remains the same as the original:\n- Same data augmentation pipeline\n- Same optimizer and learning rate scheduler\n- Same training loop structure\n- Same evaluation methodology\n\nOnly added: experiment selection, Inception v3, model saving, confusion matrix, enhanced logging, and flexible dataset handling!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import shutil\nimport os\n\n# Path to your folder\nfolder_path = \"/kaggle/working/exp4_InceptionResNetV2-FullBackbone\"  # replace with your folder\nzip_path = \"/kaggle/working/exp4_InceptionResNetV2-FullBackbone.zip\"  # output zip file\n\n# Create a zip archive\nshutil.make_archive(base_name=zip_path.replace('.zip',''), format='zip', root_dir=folder_path)\n\nprint(f\"ZIP created at: {zip_path}\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-29T20:17:35.189923Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-29T20:17:35.190247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-29T20:18:35.879554Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-29T20:17:35.190203Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-29T20:18:35.878918Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"ZIP created at: /kaggle/working/exp4_InceptionResNetV2-FullBackbone.zip\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24}]}
